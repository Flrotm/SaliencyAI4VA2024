- **Abstract** : We present a novel approach for saliency map prediction
by integrating text detection into a Vision Transformer (ViT) frame-
work. Our method leverages EasyOCR for text region detection, adding
a fourth channel to the input images to enhance the modelâ€™s focus on
text areas. We fine-tune a ViT model with an adapted patch embedding
layer and combine it with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for
local feature extraction.
